# ProjectDOTSBots
Game made with Unity DOTS. RTS mixed with third person shooting action. Destroy the mega robot!

## FAQ
There seem to be a lot of people confused and frustrated with Unity's new approach with DOTS and HDRP. Pretty understandable... I am not a guru on the subject, but I have been working in DOTS full time for the past year, and I've got a pretty good grasp of how to use it.
So I'm going to stream the creation of a small, but fully functional game based on DOTS and HDRP. The whole creation will be streamed with all code and assets freely available though a public GitHub repository.
I'm doing this because I want to help people get started with DOTS, and maybe get some input on my coding abilities. I'm not looking to make money on this, at least for now.
If this would turn out to be useful and appreciate by people, I'm might consider monetizing it somehow. But for now, totally free with no string attached.

The game is a RTS/Third person action hybrid. I'm not trying to make something super original or super bland. I'm trying to do something that sounds fun to me and has a few varied mechanics, so as many people has possible can find something useful in the project.
